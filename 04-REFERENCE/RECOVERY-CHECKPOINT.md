# RECOVERY CHECKPOINT — ALGO ECOSYSTEM

> Current governed recovery state for `thboulevart-creator/ADAPTIVE-TRADING-DECISION-SYSTEM`.
>
> GitHub is the source of truth. If the repository disagrees with this checkpoint, stop and diagnose the discrepancy before mutation.

## 1. Current workstream

Repository:

`thboulevart-creator/ADAPTIVE-TRADING-DECISION-SYSTEM`

Branch:

`integration/system-v1`

End-of-day session backup:

`99-BACKUP/SESSION-2026-09-18-P1.9-P1.14-QUALIFICATION-CHAIN.md`

Backup commit:

`06a1b383a3b0279daf44a5f59e5daa48a35c6946`

Technical common-HEAD immediately before backup/checkpoint persistence:

`3046293373c41de101008bea8f1f861b1db9081d`

Always verify the live branch HEAD before writing. The checkpoint/backup commits are documentary descendants of that technical state.

Current block:

`PRE-BACKTEST — CONCRETE EXECUTABLE DATA GATE CLOSURE`

---

## 2. Governing method

Required progression:

```text
UNDERSTAND → COMPARE → BREAK → DECIDE
```

Then:

```text
formalisation → candidate → adversarial break → correction → re-break → verdict
```

Allowed verdicts:

`PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED`

Never declare PASS without persisted-HEAD final re-break.

Do not reconstruct state from conversation if GitHub is available.

---

## 3. Global safety truth

The following remain unchanged:

- no native `.bi5` acquisition is authorized;
- no real-data acquisition is authorized by this workstream;
- no real backtest is authorized;
- no broker/live activation is authorized;
- P1.1 positive `AUTHORIZED` remains separately BLOCKED;
- request/evidence/experiment objects do not imply operational authorization.

The separation remains:

```text
request ≠ evidence ≠ execution ≠ authorization
```

---

## 6. P1.13 qualified state

### P1.13A

Contract:

`P1_13A_EVIDENCE_SEMANTIC_COMPLETENESS_REVIEW_SUBMISSION_BOUNDARY_V1`

Runtime:

`src/evidence_semantic_completeness_review.py`

Runtime blob:

Final breaker blob:

`840be30d17a31c8da8c8c57bc8902073de462b58`

Always:

```text

```

### P1.13B

Contract:

`P1_13B_EXPERIMENT_EVALUATION_SUBMISSION_BOUNDARY_V1`

Runtime:

`src/experiment_evaluation_submission.py`

Runtime blob:

Final breaker blob:

`aea742767512c0f318744ab8eeade6f4155c2840`

The final breaker helper uses a sentinel so explicit `None` reaches the runtime rather than being replaced by the omitted-argument default.

Always:

```text
measurement_provenance_status = BLOCKED
evaluation_authority_status = BLOCKED
```

Final P1.13 persisted HEAD:

`51abe3cc3f556384b9ab3d89d79a375f8b7e8245`

## 7. P1.14 selected contracts

### P1.14A

Contract:

`P1_14A_REVIEWER_METHOD_AUTHORITY_REATTESTATION_BOUNDARY_V1`

Selected model:

`P1_14A_MINIMAL_REVIEWER_METHOD_AUTHORITY_REATTESTATION_MODEL_V1`

Runtime:

`src/reviewer_method_authority.py`

Runtime blob:

`d56374ab05b07b8a05eafbbba9dde2875ef4f507`

Breaker:

`breakers/p1_14a_reviewer_method_authority_breaker.py`

Current breaker blob:

`f63f24cee1667839edd457f4bd76632fba063544`

Meaning of positive output:

```text
review_authority_status = PASS
request_fulfillment_status = BLOCKED
```

PASS authority means only an externally pinned authority attests the exact reviewer/method/review binding.

It does not mean semantic truth or request fulfillment.

### P1.14B

Contract:

`P1_14B_WITNESSED_MEASUREMENT_PROVENANCE_REATTESTATION_BOUNDARY_V1`

Selected model:

`P1_14B_MINIMAL_WITNESSED_MEASUREMENT_PROVENANCE_MODEL_V1`

Runtime:

`src/experiment_measurement_provenance.py`

Runtime blob:

`4ce8ceb7e46ac2f6ffbd97560225d559ea7757f5`

Breaker:

`breakers/p1_14b_measurement_provenance_breaker.py`

Breaker blob:

`24d8dcd980ec421c75207930174a42cbd62a3b46`

Meaning of positive output:

```text
measurement_provenance_status = PASS
evaluation_authority_status = BLOCKED
finding_status = BLOCKED
```

PASS provenance proves externally witnessed lineage to the exact execution stream and hashed procedures, not mathematical correctness or finding truth.

---

## 8. P1.14 test-first baseline

P1.14A preimplementation:

- run `35386382173`;
- job `105734173160`;
- protected chain through P1.13A+B: PASS;
- P1.13A+B: `92 passed`;
- P1.14A: `34 errors`;
- every error due only to absent `src/reviewer_method_authority`;
- clean worktree.

P1.14B preimplementation:

- run `35386416259`;
- job `105734283344`;
- protected chain through P1.13A+B: PASS;
- P1.13A+B: `92 passed`;
- P1.14B: `38 errors`;
- every error due only to absent `src/experiment_measurement_provenance`;
- clean worktree.

This is valid test-first red evidence.

---

## 9. P1.14 postimplementation common-HEAD re-break

Technical common HEAD:

`3046293373c41de101008bea8f1f861b1db9081d`

### P1.14B

Run:

`35387213254`

Job:

`105736808596`

Result:

- protected chain through P1.13A+B: PASS;
- P1.14B: `38 passed`;
- clean worktree: PASS.

Current verdict:

`PASS CANDIDATE`

Not final because P1.14 global common HEAD is not yet green.

### P1.14A

Run:

`35387213271`

Job:

`105736808586`

Result:

- protected chain through P1.13A+B: PASS;
- P1.14A: `33 passed, 1 failed`;
- clean worktree: PASS.

Sole failure:

`test_c1_external_pin_exact_sha256[None]`

Exact root cause is in the breaker helper:

```python
def _reattest(review, paths, *, authority_id=REVIEW_AUTHORITY, pin=None):
    record_path, receipt_path, receipt_sha256 = paths
    return _p114a().reattest_reviewer_method_authority(
        review,
        record_path,
        receipt_path,
        expected_authority_id=authority_id,
        expected_receipt_sha256=receipt_sha256 if pin is None else pin,
    )
```

The parametrized attack explicitly passes `None`, but the helper replaces it with the valid receipt pin.

Therefore explicit `None` never reaches the runtime.

This is a demonstrated breaker-helper defect, not a demonstrated runtime defect.

Do not modify the runtime to inspect tests/stacks or otherwise fake rejection.

---

## 10. Current verdict

```text
P1.14A
BLOCKED — breaker helper masks explicit None

P1.14B
PASS CANDIDATE

P1.14 GLOBAL QUALIFICATION
BLOCKED
```

No P1.14 qualification candidate has been persisted.

No final P1.14 PASS exists.

---

## 11. Mandatory semantic separations

```text
ReviewerMethodAuthorityQualification
≠ semantic truth
≠ request fulfillment
≠ knowledge
≠ operational authorization
```

```text
WitnessedMeasurementProvenance
≠ measurement correctness
≠ evaluator authority
≠ qualified experimental finding
≠ ResearchRunEvidence
≠ evidence
≠ knowledge
≠ operational authorization
```

Also:

```text
qualified reviewer authority
≠ request fulfillment

witnessed measurement provenance
≠ qualified experimental finding
```

Future promotion boundaries must remain explicit.

---

## 12. Mandatory recovery order

Read in this order:

1. `04-REFERENCE/AI-OPERATING-MEMORY.md`
2. this `04-REFERENCE/RECOVERY-CHECKPOINT.md`
3. `99-BACKUP/SESSION-2026-09-18-P1.9-P1.14-QUALIFICATION-CHAIN.md`
4. `GOVERNANCE/STEP-3-REAL-SYSTEM-MAPPING.md`
5. `breakers/p1_14a_reviewer_method_authority_breaker.py`
6. `.github/workflows/p1-14a-reviewer-method-authority.yml`
7. `src/reviewer_method_authority.py`
8. `breakers/p1_14b_measurement_provenance_breaker.py`
9. `.github/workflows/p1-14b-measurement-provenance.yml`
10. `src/experiment_measurement_provenance.py`
11. verify real `integration/system-v1` HEAD and compare with this checkpoint before mutation.

GitHub wins if there is any discrepancy.

---

## 13. Do not repeat / do not do

- Do not re-formalize P1.9–P1.14.
- Do not reimplement P1.14 runtimes.
- Do not modify P1.14B.
- Do not fake a P1.14A runtime fix for the explicit-None failure.
- Do not remove `None` from the P1.14A attack.
- Do not weaken the P1.14A assertion.
- Do not alter the other 33 P1.14A attacks.
- Do not jump directly to a qualification commit before a new common-HEAD A+B re-break.
- Do not infer fulfillment or finding from P1.14.
- Do not authorize real acquisition/backtest/live execution.

---

## 14. Exactly one next governed action

**Correct only the demonstrated P1.14A breaker helper ambiguity so explicit `None` reaches `reattest_reviewer_method_authority()`, without changing either runtime, without removing `None`, without weakening the assertion, and without changing the other 33 attacks.**

Use an omitted-argument sentinel, e.g.:

```python
_DEFAULT_PIN = object()

def _reattest(..., pin=_DEFAULT_PIN):
    ...
    expected_receipt_sha256=(
        receipt_sha256 if pin is _DEFAULT_PIN else pin
    )
```

Then:

1. update only the P1.14A workflow breaker hash lock;
2. run targeted P1.14A re-break;
3. require P1.14A `34/34 PASS`;
4. persist the breaker correction in governance;
5. use that governance commit as a common HEAD for P1.14A+B;
6. require A and B both green on that exact common HEAD;
7. persist P1.14 qualification candidate;
8. re-break A and B on that exact persisted qualification HEAD;
9. verify branch identity, breaker blobs, runtime blobs and clean worktrees;
10. only then issue final PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED.

---

## 15. Probable next work after P1.14 final qualification

Only after P1.14 is final PASS:

### Evidence branch

Design an explicit boundary for:

```text
qualified reviewer authority
→ request fulfillment decision
```

without equating reviewer authority with fulfillment automatically.

### Experiment branch

Design an explicit boundary for:

```text
witnessed measurement provenance
→ qualified experimental finding
```

which must separately address evaluator authority and/or procedure correctness before creating any finding.

Do not implement these promotion boundaries before P1.14 closes.

---

## 16. End-of-day stop rule

Stop here for 18 September 2026.

Do not correct the P1.14A breaker tonight after this checkpoint save.

Tomorrow resume from GitHub, this checkpoint, and the dated backup — not from conversational memory.


---

## 17. P1.14 final qualification closure

P1.14 is now fully qualified.

Qualified persisted HEAD:

`bbd4e382f5ce744438079015eb11826aff64be74`

Final P1.14A:

- run `35429884389`;
- job `105862447839`;
- `34 passed`;
- clean worktree.

Final P1.14B:

- run `35429884347`;
- job `105862447690`;
- `38 passed`;
- clean worktree.

Final identities:

- P1.14A breaker `ff8de568b3ed8b1e887b604a8db9d173bdbbd66b`;
- P1.14B breaker `24d8dcd980ec421c75207930174a42cbd62a3b46`;
- P1.14A runtime `d56374ab05b07b8a05eafbbba9dde2875ef4f507`;
- P1.14B runtime `4ce8ceb7e46ac2f6ffbd97560225d559ea7757f5`.

Verdict:

```text
P1.14A PASS
P1.14B PASS
```

---

## 18. P1.15 conceptual formalisation state

Governance formalisation commit:

`483227c09ad10e8be11f95b609a6420443a11b34`

No P1.15 runtime exists.

No P1.15 executable breaker exists.

### P1.15A selected minimal boundary

Contract candidate:

`P1_15A_EVIDENCE_REQUEST_FULFILLMENT_DECISION_BOUNDARY_V1`

Purpose:

```text
exact ReviewerMethodAuthorityQualification
→ explicit EvidenceRequestFulfillmentDecision
```

Deterministic promotion:

```text
review_verdict PASS    → request_fulfillment_status PASS
review_verdict FAIL    → request_fulfillment_status FAIL
review_verdict BLOCKED → request_fulfillment_status BLOCKED
```

Only an exact P1.14A authority qualification is admissible.

Fulfillment does not mean knowledge or operational authorization.

### P1.15B selected minimal boundary

Contract candidate:

`P1_15B_EXPERIMENT_EVALUATOR_METHOD_AUTHORITY_REATTESTATION_BOUNDARY_V1`

Purpose:

```text
exact ExperimentEvaluationSubmission
+
exact WitnessedMeasurementProvenance
+
external evaluator/method/procedure authority
→ QualifiedExperimentEvaluationAuthority
```

Expected positive status:

```text
evaluation_authority_status = PASS
finding_status = BLOCKED
```

P1.15B does NOT create a finding.

The actual experimental finding promotion is deferred because a governed mapping from:

- prediction status;
- falsification status;
- qualified evaluation authority;
- witnessed measurements;

to:

- SUPPORTED;
- REFUTED;
- NOT_INTERPRETABLE;

still needs its own explicit policy boundary.

---

## 19. P1.15 conceptual break verdicts

### P1.15A naive promotion

```text
ReviewerMethodAuthorityQualification
→ implicit fulfillment
```

Verdict:

`FAIL`

Reason:

reviewer authority is necessary but cannot silently mutate request-level state. An explicit promotion gate is required.

### P1.15B naive promotion

```text
WitnessedMeasurementProvenance
→ qualified experimental finding
```

Verdict:

`FAIL`

Reasons:

- provenance is not evaluator authority;
- provenance is not method authority;
- procedure hashes are identity, not correctness;
- P1.14B lacks complete finding interpretation policy;
- current `ResearchFindings` structural factory does not prove this authority chain.

---

## 20. Exactly one next governed action

Create only the P1.15 test-first executable breakers and their workflows, with no P1.15 runtime implementation yet:

- `breakers/p1_15a_evidence_request_fulfillment_breaker.py`;
- `.github/workflows/p1-15a-evidence-request-fulfillment.yml`;
- `breakers/p1_15b_experiment_evaluator_authority_breaker.py`;
- `.github/workflows/p1-15b-experiment-evaluator-authority.yml`.

The breakers must encode the conceptual attack sets already frozen in governance.

Then run pre-implementation qualification and require:

- protected chain through P1.14A+B PASS;
- P1.15A FAIL only because its runtime candidate is absent;
- P1.15B FAIL only because its runtime candidate is absent;
- clean worktrees.

Do not implement either P1.15 runtime before those expected red baselines exist.



---

## 21. P1.15 final qualification closure

P1.15 is fully qualified.

Qualified persisted HEAD:

`e61381813c0539c1339aec6e01310d4046f9dbe3`

Final P1.15A:

- run `35433285721`;
- job `105871556471`;
- `19 passed`;
- clean worktree.

Final P1.15B:

- run `35433285730`;
- job `105871556484`;
- `38 passed`;
- clean worktree.

Final identities:

- P1.15A breaker `bc057806d1a31072258caafb26a3e4c6de8d7448`;
- P1.15B breaker `b077c7e81e60066aed712f8c9212378e3b08916c`;
- P1.15A runtime `a13ec4b3a5ceb44266b214e69c4e596519966050`;
- P1.15B runtime `bfab3c421263434d5e3e3066720f95abb521b09c`.

Verdict:

```text
P1.15A PASS
P1.15B PASS
```

---

## 22. P1.16 selected experimental finding policy

Governance formalisation commit:

`00061b577c5f4212000b9343cbe35bd6781128bb`

Contract candidate:

`P1_16_QUALIFIED_EXPERIMENTAL_FINDING_INTERPRETATION_BOUNDARY_V1`

Policy constant candidate:

`P1_16_FINDING_INTERPRETATION_POLICY_V1`

Future runtime:

`src/qualified_experimental_finding.py`

No P1.16 runtime exists yet.

No P1.16 executable breaker exists yet.

### Total interpretation table

```text
SUPPORTED     + NOT_FALSIFIED → SUPPORTED
NOT_SUPPORTED + FALSIFIED     → REFUTED

SUPPORTED     + FALSIFIED     → NOT_INTERPRETABLE
NOT_SUPPORTED + NOT_FALSIFIED → NOT_INTERPRETABLE

any pair containing BLOCKED    → NOT_INTERPRETABLE
```

Interpretation codes:

- `PREDICTION_SUPPORTED_AND_NOT_FALSIFIED`;
- `PREDICTION_NOT_SUPPORTED_AND_FALSIFIED`;
- `CONTRADICTORY_EVALUATION_STATUSES`;
- `NON_DECISIVE_EVALUATION_STATUSES`;
- `BLOCKED_EVALUATION_STATUS`.

The table is total over all 9 valid status pairs.

### Minimal authoritative inputs

- exact factory-attested `ExperimentEvaluationSubmission`;
- exact factory-attested `QualifiedExperimentEvaluationAuthority`.

No caller may supply:

- finding status;
- interpretation code;
- policy reference;
- supporting measurement IDs.

### Candidate output

`QualifiedExperimentalFinding`

This remains distinct from:

- `ResearchFinding`;
- `ResearchFindings`;
- `ResearchRunEvidence`;
- durable knowledge;
- operational authorization.

---

## 23. Exactly one next governed action

Create only the P1.16 test-first breaker and workflow:

- `breakers/p1_16_qualified_experimental_finding_breaker.py`;
- `.github/workflows/p1-16-qualified-experimental-finding.yml`.

Do not create `src/qualified_experimental_finding.py` yet.

The breaker must exercise all 9 status pairs and prove:

- only the two decisive pairs promote to SUPPORTED / REFUTED;
- contradictory, non-decisive and BLOCKED pairs become NOT_INTERPRETABLE;
- no caller override surface exists;
- exact P1.13B/P1.15B authority chain is required;
- no ResearchFinding/ResearchFindings/ResearchRunEvidence production occurs;
- no knowledge or operational authorization occurs.

Then require:

- protected chain through P1.15A+B PASS;
- P1.16 FAIL only because runtime candidate is absent;
- clean worktree.



---

## 24. P1.16 final qualification closure

P1.16 is fully qualified.

Qualified persisted HEAD:

`224e33187730739c49a0bf5dd3c6343023db7120`

Final P1.16:

- contract `P1_16_QUALIFIED_EXPERIMENTAL_FINDING_INTERPRETATION_BOUNDARY_V1`;
- breaker `afbb1442f5c2335e2bcaedb7f65f6ecb9249910a`;
- runtime `a5c6b820df5ea5e89fd61c84feb42cb42e923a5f`;
- workflow `7feaf435efe72d77bf7a0a87b710fd9cf87f929f`;
- run `35434110314`;
- job `105873759979`;
- `37 passed`;
- protected chain through P1.15A+B PASS;
- clean worktree.

Verdict:

```text
P1.16 PASS
```

Strict separation remains:

```text
QualifiedExperimentalFinding
≠ ResearchFinding
≠ ResearchFindings
≠ ResearchRunEvidence
≠ durable knowledge
≠ decision authority
≠ operational authorization
```

## 25. Pre-backtest concrete executable gate reconciliation

Durable audit:

`reports/data-qualification/pre_backtest_concrete_gate_reconciliation_2026-09-19.md`

Audit closure commit:

`c8dbaeecf86f5092ded9fddf2f863f5e903f5d89`

Latest session backup:

`99-BACKUP/SESSION-2026-09-19-PRE-BACKTEST-CONCRETE-GATE-RECONCILIATION.md`

Backup commit:

`b13ac860c7580219ac5f281ff53e630980de94a0`

The historical ten-input register was reconciled item-by-item against the live repository, with each verdict persisted before opening the next item.

Final current matrix:

```text
D   Acquisition declaration + complete component manifest   BLOCKED
R   Representation identity/version                         BLOCKED
M   Record-model version                                    BLOCKED
B   Concrete format binding(s)                              BLOCKED
A   Concrete anomaly matrix                                 BLOCKED
Q   Qualification contract + parameters                     BLOCKED
F   Freeze artifact + persistence                           BLOCKED
O   Deterministic semantic comparison oracle                BLOCKED
I_A Reference implementation                                BLOCKED
I_B Independent comparison implementation                   BLOCKED
```

These are current evidence verdicts, not inherited historical labels.

No item was promoted to PASS merely because adjacent code exists.

### D

BLOCKED because Q-RM-08 schema exists but no project-specific immutable Dukascopy acquisition declaration + actual complete component manifest exists.

### R

BLOCKED because CSV/BI5/Parquet parser support exists but no concrete normative representation identity/version has been selected for this gate.

### M

BLOCKED because the semantic record-model family is defined but the record-model freeze/version remains unresolved.

### B

BLOCKED because parsing implementations exist, including native BI5 decoding knowledge, but the Q-RM-09 concrete versioned binding artifact does not.

### A

BLOCKED because the universal Q-RM-10 failure policy is PASS but no concrete binding-specific anomaly registry exists.

### Q

BLOCKED because the execution-window freeze and Momentum V1 baseline protocol solve different scopes; no concrete data-qualification contract binds D/R/M/B/A.

### F

BLOCKED because the persisted execution-window freeze is not the Q-RM-11 qualified logical-occurrence-universe snapshot.

### O

BLOCKED because Q-RM-12 specifies oracle semantics but no executable semantic Universe(A)=Universe(B) oracle exists.

### I_A

BLOCKED because useful implementation building blocks exist, but no complete conforming reference path currently consumes the concrete semantic tuple and produces F for O.

### I_B

BLOCKED because no independently implemented second qualification path exists.

## 26. Existing foundations that remain valid

Do not rebuild merely because the concrete data gate is BLOCKED:

- P0.6 reproducible qualification environment;
- selected `USATECHIDXUSD` window `2021-08-14 → 2026-08-14`;
- selected-window calendar `68 / 68 / 0`;
- persisted execution-window freeze;
- Momentum V1 first baseline protocol PASS;
- CSV reader/admissibility code;
- native Dukascopy BI5 decoding knowledge in V4.3;
- Parquet compatibility path;
- Q-RM-01..12 universal semantic/falsifiability architecture;
- P1.2..P1.16 qualified evidence/experiment/result chain.

The missing object is the concrete executable data-qualification package, not a replacement for these qualified foundations.

---

## 27. Current real-execution safety truth

```text
real data acquisition       = NOT AUTHORIZED
massive acquisition         = false / NOT AUTHORIZED
real backtest               = false / NOT AUTHORIZED
positive P1.1 AUTHORIZED    = BLOCKED
paper / broker / live       = NOT AUTHORIZED
```

No real data acquisition, BI5 download, real dataset qualification run, real backtest or broker/live action occurred during the reconciliation.

---

## 28. Required closure dependency order

```text
D + R + M
    ↓
B + A
    ↓
Q
    ↓
F + O
    ↓
I_A + I_B
    ↓
Q-RM-12 real determinism execution
    ↓
Universe(A) = Universe(B)
+
mandatory adversarial variants conform
    ↓
FINAL EXECUTABLE DATA GATE = PASS
```

A bounded real acquisition/backtest permission remains a later, separate governed promotion.

---

## 29. Exactly one next governed action

Formalize only, without acquiring data and without granting any execution permission, the first concrete `D + R + M` candidate package for the bounded Dukascopy `USATECHIDXUSD` research acquisition associated with the already-frozen execution window.

The formalisation must preserve:

```text
acquisition declaration contract / expected membership rule
≠ actual acquired component manifest

representation selection
≠ parser implementation

record-model version
≠ format-specific binding

candidate design
≠ qualification PASS
```

The actual component manifest remains BLOCKED until a separately authorized acquisition later produces real acquisition evidence.

Do not start B/A/Q/F/O/I_A/I_B implementation before D/R/M formalisation has been adversarially broken and adjudicated.

## 30. First concrete D/R/M candidate formalization — persisted

The first concrete pre-backtest `D + R + M` candidate block has been formalized, broken, minimally corrected and re-broken.

Candidate artifact:

`reports/data-qualification/drm_first_concrete_candidate_formalization_2026-09-19.md`

Initial candidate commit:

`ed1a55047df1d3402fa35ef19f3a662070d590db`

Initial adversarial break:

Break commit:

`43d18ec3838a381c814761bc2cf3ff8726e38d90`

Initial candidate verdict:

`FAIL`

Demonstrated defects:

```text
DRM-F01 — WARMUP_DOMAIN_MEMBERSHIP_UNDERSPECIFIED
DRM-F02 — RECORD_MODEL_RETAINED_CANDIDATE_WORDING_LEAK
```

Minimal correction commit:

Corrected candidate blob:

`2249bea6dbf6b5a8e0d49b99a93bf16248f9c0e9`

Final adversarial artifact blob:

`8e29d132d8a2eaf28bd9901f2bed33392cccfc79`

No additional candidate defect was demonstrated after correction.

### Current candidate D semantics

```text
candidate contract =
D_DUKASCOPY_USATECHIDXUSD_BOUNDED_RESEARCH_ACQUISITION_DECLARATION_V0_1
```

The future declared acquisition domain must include:

```text
mandatory deterministic warmup prefix
+
frozen five-year evaluation window
```

The warmup prefix satisfies the frozen `20 completed H1 bars` requirement under the governed session-calendar contract.

No actual acquisition-domain instance ID, component manifest or completeness evidence has been fabricated.

### Current candidate R semantics

```text
representation_id =
DUKASCOPY_NATIVE_BI5_HOURLY_TICKS

representation_version =
DUKASCOPY_NATIVE_BI5_HOURLY_TICKS_V1_CANDIDATE
```

Native BI5 is selected as the first-path candidate because it preserves provider-native source material without mandatory pre-qualification conversion.

Parser support is not normative authority.

Filename/path syntax is not normative UTC-hour provenance.

### Current candidate M semantics

```text
record_model_version =
PRIMARY_MARKET_TICK_LOGICAL_RECORD_MODEL_V1_CANDIDATE
```

M is:

- format-neutral;
- occurrence-based;
- strict-duplicate preserving;
- pre-Q;
- non-canonical;
- non-temporal;
- acquisition-scope compatible.

B owns physical BI5 segmentation/scaling/framing.

Q owns retained qualification membership.

### Official gate verdicts remain

```text
D = BLOCKED
R = BLOCKED
M = BLOCKED
```

This is deliberate.

The corrected candidate is stable enough to become input to the next specification block, but it is not qualified concrete data.

## 31. Durable D/R/M backup

Latest dedicated backup:

Global reconciliation audit update commit:

`67b49d18fd6ef6612dff3edb36ebe3a5cc497d23`

No B/A implementation or data acquisition occurred before this checkpoint.

---

## 32. Exactly one next governed action

Formalize only:

```text
B — concrete native BI5 format binding
+
A — concrete BI5 anomaly matrix
```

using the corrected D/R/M candidate as immutable candidate input.

Requirements:

- no acquisition;
- no real BI5 processing;
- no real backtest;
- no permission increase;
- do not make filenames/path patterns normative;
- do not let the existing V4.3 parser become binding authority by implication;
- distinguish physical BI5 framing/field/scaling semantics from M;
- bind concrete BI5 anomaly classes to Q-RM-10 outcomes;
- adversarially break B/A before any implementation;
- if B/A would require changing D/R/M semantics, stop with FAIL/BLOCKED rather than mutating D/R/M silently.
