> GitHub is the source of truth. If the repository disagrees with this checkpoint, stop and diagnose the discrepancy before mutation.

## 1. Current workstream

Repository:

`thboulevart-creator/ADAPTIVE-TRADING-DECISION-SYSTEM`

Branch:

`integration/system-v1`

End-of-day session backup:

`99-BACKUP/SESSION-2026-09-18-P1.9-P1.14-QUALIFICATION-CHAIN.md`

Backup commit:

`06a1b383a3b0279daf44a5f59e5daa48a35c6946`

Technical common-HEAD immediately before backup/checkpoint persistence:

`3046293373c41de101008bea8f1f861b1db9081d`

Always verify the live branch HEAD before writing. The checkpoint/backup commits are documentary descendants of that technical state.

Current block:

`P1.14 — EXTERNAL REVIEW AUTHORITY / WITNESSED MEASUREMENT PROVENANCE`

---

## 2. Governing method

Required progression:

```text
UNDERSTAND → COMPARE → BREAK → DECIDE
```

Then:

```text
formalisation → candidate → adversarial break → correction → re-break → verdict
```

Allowed verdicts:

`PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED`

Never declare PASS without persisted-HEAD final re-break.

Do not reconstruct state from conversation if GitHub is available.

---

## 3. Global safety truth

The following remain unchanged:

- no native `.bi5` acquisition is authorized;
- no real-data acquisition is authorized by this workstream;
- no real backtest is authorized;
- no broker/live activation is authorized;
- P1.1 positive `AUTHORIZED` remains separately BLOCKED;
- request/evidence/experiment objects do not imply operational authorization.

The separation remains:

```text
request ≠ evidence ≠ execution ≠ authorization
```

---

Runtime:

`src/evidence_semantic_completeness_review.py`

Runtime blob:

Final breaker blob:

`840be30d17a31c8da8c8c57bc8902073de462b58`

Always:

```text

Final breaker blob:

`aea742767512c0f318744ab8eeade6f4155c2840`

The final breaker helper uses a sentinel so explicit `None` reaches the runtime rather than being replaced by the omitted-argument default.

Always:

```text
measurement_provenance_status = BLOCKED
evaluation_authority_status = BLOCKED
```

## 7. P1.14 selected contracts

### P1.14A

Contract:

`P1_14A_REVIEWER_METHOD_AUTHORITY_REATTESTATION_BOUNDARY_V1`

Selected model:

`P1_14A_MINIMAL_REVIEWER_METHOD_AUTHORITY_REATTESTATION_MODEL_V1`

Runtime:

`src/reviewer_method_authority.py`

Runtime blob:

`d56374ab05b07b8a05eafbbba9dde2875ef4f507`

Breaker:

`breakers/p1_14a_reviewer_method_authority_breaker.py`

Current breaker blob:

`f63f24cee1667839edd457f4bd76632fba063544`

Meaning of positive output:

```text
review_authority_status = PASS
request_fulfillment_status = BLOCKED
```

PASS authority means only an externally pinned authority attests the exact reviewer/method/review binding.

It does not mean semantic truth or request fulfillment.

### P1.14B

Contract:

`P1_14B_WITNESSED_MEASUREMENT_PROVENANCE_REATTESTATION_BOUNDARY_V1`

Selected model:

`P1_14B_MINIMAL_WITNESSED_MEASUREMENT_PROVENANCE_MODEL_V1`

Runtime:

`src/experiment_measurement_provenance.py`

Runtime blob:

`4ce8ceb7e46ac2f6ffbd97560225d559ea7757f5`

Breaker:

`breakers/p1_14b_measurement_provenance_breaker.py`

Breaker blob:

`24d8dcd980ec421c75207930174a42cbd62a3b46`

Meaning of positive output:

```text
measurement_provenance_status = PASS
evaluation_authority_status = BLOCKED
finding_status = BLOCKED
```

PASS provenance proves externally witnessed lineage to the exact execution stream and hashed procedures, not mathematical correctness or finding truth.

---

## 8. P1.14 test-first baseline

P1.14A preimplementation:

- run `35386382173`;
- job `105734173160`;
- protected chain through P1.13A+B: PASS;
- P1.13A+B: `92 passed`;
- P1.14A: `34 errors`;
- every error due only to absent `src/reviewer_method_authority`;
- clean worktree.

P1.14B preimplementation:

- run `35386416259`;
- job `105734283344`;
- protected chain through P1.13A+B: PASS;
- P1.13A+B: `92 passed`;
- P1.14B: `38 errors`;
- every error due only to absent `src/experiment_measurement_provenance`;
- clean worktree.

This is valid test-first red evidence.

---

## 9. P1.14 postimplementation common-HEAD re-break

Technical common HEAD:

`3046293373c41de101008bea8f1f861b1db9081d`

### P1.14B

Run:

`35387213254`

Job:

`105736808596`

Result:

- protected chain through P1.13A+B: PASS;
- P1.14B: `38 passed`;
- clean worktree: PASS.

Current verdict:

`PASS CANDIDATE`

Not final because P1.14 global common HEAD is not yet green.

### P1.14A

Run:

`35387213271`

Job:

`105736808586`

Result:

- protected chain through P1.13A+B: PASS;
- P1.14A: `33 passed, 1 failed`;
- clean worktree: PASS.

Sole failure:

`test_c1_external_pin_exact_sha256[None]`

Exact root cause is in the breaker helper:

```python
def _reattest(review, paths, *, authority_id=REVIEW_AUTHORITY, pin=None):
    record_path, receipt_path, receipt_sha256 = paths
    return _p114a().reattest_reviewer_method_authority(
        review,
        record_path,
        receipt_path,
        expected_authority_id=authority_id,
        expected_receipt_sha256=receipt_sha256 if pin is None else pin,
    )
```

The parametrized attack explicitly passes `None`, but the helper replaces it with the valid receipt pin.

Therefore explicit `None` never reaches the runtime.

This is a demonstrated breaker-helper defect, not a demonstrated runtime defect.

Do not modify the runtime to inspect tests/stacks or otherwise fake rejection.

---

## 10. Current verdict

```text
P1.14A
BLOCKED — breaker helper masks explicit None

P1.14B
PASS CANDIDATE

P1.14 GLOBAL QUALIFICATION
BLOCKED
```

No P1.14 qualification candidate has been persisted.

No final P1.14 PASS exists.

---

## 11. Mandatory semantic separations

```text
ReviewerMethodAuthorityQualification
≠ semantic truth
≠ request fulfillment
≠ knowledge
≠ operational authorization
```

```text
WitnessedMeasurementProvenance
≠ measurement correctness
≠ evaluator authority
≠ qualified experimental finding
≠ ResearchRunEvidence
≠ evidence
≠ knowledge
≠ operational authorization
```

Also:

```text
qualified reviewer authority
≠ request fulfillment

witnessed measurement provenance
≠ qualified experimental finding
```

Future promotion boundaries must remain explicit.

---

## 12. Mandatory recovery order

Read in this order:

1. `04-REFERENCE/AI-OPERATING-MEMORY.md`
2. this `04-REFERENCE/RECOVERY-CHECKPOINT.md`
3. `99-BACKUP/SESSION-2026-09-18-P1.9-P1.14-QUALIFICATION-CHAIN.md`
4. `GOVERNANCE/STEP-3-REAL-SYSTEM-MAPPING.md`
5. `breakers/p1_14a_reviewer_method_authority_breaker.py`
6. `.github/workflows/p1-14a-reviewer-method-authority.yml`
7. `src/reviewer_method_authority.py`
8. `breakers/p1_14b_measurement_provenance_breaker.py`
9. `.github/workflows/p1-14b-measurement-provenance.yml`
10. `src/experiment_measurement_provenance.py`
11. verify real `integration/system-v1` HEAD and compare with this checkpoint before mutation.

GitHub wins if there is any discrepancy.

---

## 13. Do not repeat / do not do

- Do not re-formalize P1.9–P1.14.
- Do not reimplement P1.14 runtimes.
- Do not modify P1.14B.
- Do not fake a P1.14A runtime fix for the explicit-None failure.
- Do not remove `None` from the P1.14A attack.
- Do not weaken the P1.14A assertion.
- Do not alter the other 33 P1.14A attacks.
- Do not jump directly to a qualification commit before a new common-HEAD A+B re-break.
- Do not infer fulfillment or finding from P1.14.
- Do not authorize real acquisition/backtest/live execution.

---

## 14. Exactly one next governed action

**Correct only the demonstrated P1.14A breaker helper ambiguity so explicit `None` reaches `reattest_reviewer_method_authority()`, without changing either runtime, without removing `None`, without weakening the assertion, and without changing the other 33 attacks.**

Use an omitted-argument sentinel, e.g.:

```python
_DEFAULT_PIN = object()

def _reattest(..., pin=_DEFAULT_PIN):
    ...
    expected_receipt_sha256=(
        receipt_sha256 if pin is _DEFAULT_PIN else pin
    )
```

Then:

1. update only the P1.14A workflow breaker hash lock;
2. run targeted P1.14A re-break;
3. require P1.14A `34/34 PASS`;
4. persist the breaker correction in governance;
5. use that governance commit as a common HEAD for P1.14A+B;
6. require A and B both green on that exact common HEAD;
7. persist P1.14 qualification candidate;
8. re-break A and B on that exact persisted qualification HEAD;
9. verify branch identity, breaker blobs, runtime blobs and clean worktrees;
10. only then issue final PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED.

---

## 15. Probable next work after P1.14 final qualification

Only after P1.14 is final PASS:

### Evidence branch

Design an explicit boundary for:

```text
qualified reviewer authority
→ request fulfillment decision
```

without equating reviewer authority with fulfillment automatically.

### Experiment branch

Design an explicit boundary for:

```text
witnessed measurement provenance
→ qualified experimental finding
```

which must separately address evaluator authority and/or procedure correctness before creating any finding.

Do not implement these promotion boundaries before P1.14 closes.

---

## 16. End-of-day stop rule

Stop here for 18 September 2026.

Do not correct the P1.14A breaker tonight after this checkpoint save.

Tomorrow resume from GitHub, this checkpoint, and the dated backup — not from conversational memory.
